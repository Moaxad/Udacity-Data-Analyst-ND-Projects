# Part II - FordGoBike Dataset Exploration
## by Moayad Al-Khezayem

## Dataset

> The dataset used for this project is about bikes rides collected by a shared system in San Francisco Bay area. We will use different analysis and visualization techniques to get helpful insights from this dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> We successfully interpreted many insights from our dataset whether the insights are explatory or explanatory. The age range for all ages that use bikes varies from 18 to 100, but mostly clustred between 20 - 40. Another insight was about the relationship between the ages and the duration, we clearly saw from the scatter plot that ages between 20 and 40 have higher duration seconds comparing with older ages.
Also, we saw that even with females having much lower frequency in the data comparing with males, they have higher duration trips comparing with males.
Another insight is the age range of 70+ was surprisingly high with males and females which was not expected comparing with the duration_sec variable.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For this presentation, we'll start by looking at the variable 'duration_sec' disirbution and then we show the other plots/charts associated with this variable too see how other variables intract with it. After that we'll view the gender and age variables and their intractions.
